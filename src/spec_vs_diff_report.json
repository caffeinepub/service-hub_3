  "summary": "The implementation successfully covers all seven requirements. The backend implements a complete booking system with Motoko, including data models, CRUD operations, and filtering. The frontend uses React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, providing a booking form, bookings list with filters, status management, and a professional theme with green/blue color scheme. Generated images are referenced in components as specified.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly lists 'Payment processing integration' and 'Real-time chat' as non-goals, but does not mention authentication. The implementation includes a full Internet Identity provider setup with hooks (useInternetIdentity.ts, useActor.ts) and authentication flow, which was not requested in any requirement.",
