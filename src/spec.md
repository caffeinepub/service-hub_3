# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a service booking application for lawn mowing and car washing services.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a booking form where customers can request lawn mowing or car washing services with their name, contact information, preferred date, and address
- Build backend data model to store service bookings with customer details, service type, date, address, and booking status (pending, confirmed, completed)
- Display a list of all bookings with filtering by service type and status
- Enable service providers to update booking status from pending to confirmed or completed
- Design a professional interface with earthy greens and bright automotive blues that reflects both outdoor lawn care and car washing services
- Display service icons and hero banner as static assets

**User-visible outcome:** Customers can book lawn mowing or car washing services through a form, and service providers can view all bookings in a filterable list and update their status.
